            <h2>About Rice Diseases</h2>
            <p>Rice, one of the world's most vital crops, is susceptible to various diseases that can significantly impact yield and quality. Early detection and intervention are crucial for effective disease management in rice cultivation.</p>

            <p>Common rice diseases include:</p>

            <div class="disease-list">
                <div class="disease">
                    <h3>Bacterial Blight</h3>
                    <p>Bacterial blight is caused by the bacteria Xanthomonas oryzae. It manifests as water-soaked lesions, leading to wilting and, in severe cases, death of the plant.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="disease">
                    <h3>Brown Spot</h3>
                    <p>Brown spot, caused by the fungus Bipolaris oryzae, results in dark brown lesions on leaves. This can reduce photosynthesis and affect overall plant health.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="disease">
                    <h3>Blast Disease</h3>
                    <p>Blast disease, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, is characterized by lesions on leaves, stems, and grains. It can lead to significant yield losses.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Our advanced disease detection platform utilizes cutting-edge technology to identify and analyze symptoms at early stages, empowering farmers to take timely actions to protect their crops.</p>
